  # The is meat and potatoes specifying the algorthim with all neccessary properties/hyperparameters
  - algorithm: SPDHG
  # This needs to be outside the scope of deterministic as there are extra properties
  - algorithm/subset_sampling: deterministic
  # Due to the PD balancing step size have to find a way of ensuring that only works for PD
  - algorithm/step_size: constant
  # should only pick priors appropriately for the modality, not dumb-proofed at present...
